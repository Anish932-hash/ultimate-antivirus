# Security and Robustness Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines comprehensive security measures and robustness features to ensure the antivirus is not only powerful in detection but also secure against attacks and resilient in operation.

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **Database Encryption**: Use SQLCipher for transparent encryption of SQLite database with AES-256
- **IPC Encryption**: All inter-process communications use TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication
- **Configuration Encryption**: Sensitive settings encrypted with Windows DPAPI
- **Model Protection**: AI model files encrypted and integrity-verified on load

### Secure Storage
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for key storage
- **Secure Boot**: Verify integrity of all components during startup
- **Tamper Detection**: File integrity monitoring with hash verification

## Anti-Tampering Mechanisms

### Code Integrity
- **Code Signing**: All binaries signed with EV certificate
- **Integrity Checks**: SHA-256 verification of all executable files
- **Self-Protection**: Core engine monitors and protects its own processes
- **Memory Protection**: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), DEP, and Control Flow Guard

### Runtime Protection
- **Anti-Debugging**: Detect and prevent debugging attempts
- **Anti-Injection**: Prevent DLL injection and process hollowing

- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs to AI models
- **Model Encryption**: Protect model weights from extraction
- **Poisoning Detection**: Monitor for training data poisoning attempts

### Privacy Protection
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model updates
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for AI training
- **Anonymization**: Remove PII from training data

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
- **CPU Optimization**: SIMD instructions, multi-threading, and CPU affinity
- **Memory Management**: Custom allocators, memory pooling, and leak prevention
- **I/O Optimization**: Asynchronous I/O, caching, and SSD-aware algorithms
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA/OpenCL for AI inference on supported hardware

### Scalability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute scanning across CPU cores
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable CPU/memory limits to prevent system impact
- **Adaptive Scanning**: Adjust scan intensity based on system load

## Robustness and Reliability

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with reduced features on failures
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing mechanisms for component failures
- **Fallback Modes**: Traditional detection when AI is unavailable

### Fault Tolerance
- **Redundancy**: Multiple instances of critical components
- **Checkpointing**: Save scan progress for resumability
- **Isolation**: Sandboxed execution to prevent fault propagation

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of component health
- **Performance Metrics**: Track latency, throughput, and resource usage
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in troubleshooting and log analysis

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data protection and user consent management
- **Industry Standards**: Follow NIST, ISO 27001 security frameworks
- **Transparency**: Clear privacy policies and data usage disclosures

### Audit Trail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged with timestamps and user context
- **Log Integrity**: Tamper-proof log files with cryptographic chaining
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable log retention with secure deletion

## Incident Response
