## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Key Dependencies
- **Database Layer**: Required for all data-intensive features
- **Core Engine**: Foundation for scanning and protection features
- **AI Integration**: Depends on stable IPC and data layer
- **GUI**: Requires core engine and AI for full functionality
- **Security**: Must be implemented throughout all phases

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Development**: GUI and AI can develop in parallel after core is stable
- **Incremental Releases**: Each milestone produces a testable version
- **Fallback Options**: Traditional detection available if AI fails
- **Modular Design**: Components can be developed and tested independently

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure
- **Core Developers (C++)**: 2 developers for scanning engine and system integration
- **GUI Developers (C#)**: 2 developers for user interface and experience
- **AI/ML Engineers**: 2 engineers for machine learning models and integration
- **Security Specialists**: 1 specialist for security implementation
- **DevOps/QA**: 2 engineers for testing, deployment, and infrastructure

### Technology Requirements
- **Development Environment**: Windows 10/11 workstations with Visual Studio
- **Build Servers**: CI/CD with Windows containers
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Isolated test environments and malware samples
- **Cloud Resources**: Azure/AWS for development and testing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Detection Rate**: >99.5% for known threats
- **False Positive Rate**: <0.1%
- **Scan Performance**: <2 minutes for full system scan
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB idle, <500MB during scan
- **AI Accuracy**: >95% for anomaly detection

### Quality Metrics

## Contingency Plans

### Schedule Delays
- **AI Complexity**: If AI development takes longer, prioritize traditional detection
- **Integration Issues**: Have fallback implementations for external services
- **Security Requirements**: Implement basic security first, enhance iteratively

### Technical Challenges
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and optimize critical paths
- **Compatibility Problems**: Test on multiple Windows versions from start
- **Scalability Concerns**: Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
