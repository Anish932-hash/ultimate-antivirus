  map<string, string> metadata = 3;
}
```

### Model Management
- **Model Registry**: Store model versions, metadata, and performance metrics in database
- **A/B Testing**: Deploy new models alongside existing ones for comparison
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback to previous model on performance degradation
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for models with compatibility checks

## Training and Adaptation

### Initial Training
- **Datasets**:
  - EMBER: 1M+ labeled PE files
  - VirusTotal: Community-contributed samples

- **Transfer Learning**: Adapt pre-trained models to new threat domains

### Model Optimization
- **Quantization**: Reduce model size for deployment (8-bit, 4-bit)
- **Pruning**: Remove redundant parameters
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller models from larger teachers
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs, OpenVINO for Intel

## Performance Considerations

### Inference Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Caching**: Cache predictions for frequently scanned files
